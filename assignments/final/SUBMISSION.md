Assigment 5 was a group assignment, where the professor brought us into groups of 4 in order to work and plan together on how to create something as a team. This assignment is basically a representation of how a team would work within a company in a real world setting. In this project/assignment, we were told to create a web app, that was hosted by render, and backed by the database MONGODB. Our group decided to create an Password Manager called PassNest. PassNest, as the title is called, is a password manager that allows you to add,edit, and delete information that you've stored within the website for other websites. It is very organized, nice, and easy to use. 

What I learned from this assignment was how the server and database interacts with eachother, and how a webapp can truly come to life through java, css, and javascript. Though it was not extensive, I was able to get a bit hands on with how to set up the server, and a little bit on how the interaction between our project and the database was going. I learned what an ejs file was, I learned how to work and organize time constraints with a team. I also learned how to create pop up forms that were auto filled with information variables via the database. I also learned how fun creating an web app can be, and how this field truly can thrive with more practice. 

What I contributed and learned to do, was basically bringing the password manager to life. I created a add new button which created an overlay, and a popup form in order to input the information needed to create the "new password" to be stored within the page. Also, with the help of my teammates, I was also able to learn how to style it properly, though I did not extensively work on that portion of the project.

Overall, I had a great time creating this assignment as it felt like a real world task that one day I might encounter.

Thank you for this class professor, I hope to learn more about the webdev world, and I might even pursue a career within.
