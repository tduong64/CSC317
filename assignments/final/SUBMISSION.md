This assignment was an assigment to make us utilize our new teachings of JavaScript with what we've learned in HTML and CSS for a creation of the Iphone Calculator. This assignment required us to use HTML buttons for the calculator, and specific styling of the buttons on the calculator. CSS allowed us to create a grid of buttons, format the layout, design the coloring, and much more. This project ultimately was put together through the JavaScript as it allowed our calculator to come to life. Allowing us to input numbers via pressing buttons, or typing, and then instantly solving possible equations that were inputed. The most challenging part of this assignment was making sure all possible calculations were properly calculated just as if I were using the Iphone app. Making sure every possible error was accounted for, such as dividing by zero, or trying to press "=" before an expression was even created. Most challenges, I overcame through brute force and extra research. I won't lie, AI and youtube helped alot when looking for certain needs for the project. I don't think I did anything beyond the requirements for this project. I'd like to acknowledge that I used calculator guides off youtube, and used AI in order to answer open ended questions I had. Overall, I thought this assignment was pretty fun, and definitely helped me polish up both my CSS and HTML, whilst allowing me to create a foundation in JS.
