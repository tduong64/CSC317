Please create me a simple CSS file that takes inspiration from "Blue Lock" the anime. I am a student currently learning css and will need styling for the following sections. 

* Navigation bar 
* Header/intro section 
* About me section 
* Education section 
* Projects section 
* Valorant section 
* Footer 

Id like to have my website to have colors, style, and mood that are inspired by "Isagi Yoichi" the blue lock main character, but try to keep the look "cartoonish". Please be as meticulous when reading the sample index.html i will send below. Please provide me with comments for what each part of your css does.
with this in mind, some specific things that I would like to see are:

* a color scheme based on isagi yoichi
* cartoon, easy to read fonts
* Some simple hover effects on buttons and links, maybe some animation of isagi's flair
* Basic responsive design (works on mobile and desktop)
* Reasonable spacing between elements 

Thank you

my index.html is below: (inserted my whole code)
