## Analysis
This assignment required me to do four things. Create a css file from scratch, only using what I gained from lectures and extra research. This style.css file that was hand written took the most time because it required a decent amount of creativity and thought about how I wanted my website to be showcase. We also were required to create prompts to basically create a css file with our creativity and imagination unlocked. The first ai required only text, while the 2nd ai css required text and an image. Lastly, based on these three css files, we were to create a hybrid, basically taking each piece of what I like from each css and turning it into the most optimal and would cater it to exactly what I wanted in a css file. Each approach created a different layout and color scheme for my html, despite all being to style the same website. Overall this assignment demonstrated to me, how impacted css truly is, and that creativity and imagination is no longer just a thought, but a reality with css.

At the end of this assignment, I was able to learn css at an upper beginner/basic level. I learned how to implement basic css through the hand written one, and through the hybrid I was able to learn how to implement animations, and interactive things like hover, transform, transition, and even scroll.

## Preferred Version
I think my preferred version has to be ai-1.css because it is based on my favorite anime and anime character. I also enjoyed the cartoonish design and font that I told the ai to add. I also liked the soccer bullet point elements. Overall, I enjoyed how the website was centered, easy to read, and placed into these interactive capsules on the website. I would say the hybrid is a close second because that file truly is what is catered to me since I optimized and put the css code I want together.
