            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> My name is Tyler Duong. I lived in SF all my life. I have recently transfered from CCSF to SFSU this
                semester. I am currently an undergraduate who is currently working through his Bachelors Degree of
                Science in Computer Science., and some hobbies I really enjoy are playing video games and going on
                walks. I love reading manga/manhwa, and watching anime as well. I also enjoy challenges and learning.

            <h2>Extra Curricular</h2>
            <p> One of my favorite games of all time is Valorant. For the past 3-4 years, I have been playing this game
                whilst doing school fulltime. One could say that Valorant is basically my life and a payless job. Every
                single day I play
                around 6 hours, practicing and playing within a team in order to improve daily to become a Professional
                Player. It has been a long journey that has taught me alot about balancing life and happiness. I am very
                passionate about this dream, and hope one day I can make it so I can earn money through something I
                love. Below will be one photo I took while I was at an LAN tournament recently in Miami.</p>
